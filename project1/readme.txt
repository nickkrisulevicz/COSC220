Welcome to the StudentDlist application!

This program allows the user to manage a library database. The user has complete control over the books that are checked out.
The students/ information such as name, year of school, and ID number can be stored, as well as a list of all the books they have currently
checked out. The program works via a simple numbered list menu where the user is prompted different actions to take to manage the database.
The data structure used is singly and doubly linked lists which allows for efficient processes to add and remove data from the database.
Enjoy your new program to manage the library!
